# 🌊 Coastal Threat Alert System

## 📝 Problem Statement
Coastal communities are highly vulnerable to **erosion, flooding, storm surges, and mangrove loss**.  
Most residents often **receive warnings too late**, leading to loss of homes, boats, farmlands, and even lives.  
There is no simple, community-driven, real-time alert system that combines **local observations** with **scientific data** to prevent such disasters.

---

## 💡 Our Solution
We propose a **Coastal Threat Alert System** that allows communities to:  
1. **Report threats** (erosion, flooding, debris, mangrove cutting) by submitting **photos + location**.  
2. **Verify risks** by combining reports with **live weather and tide API data**.  
3. **Issue alerts** to people in at-risk areas via the app (and later via SMS/notifications).  

This creates a **community-driven early warning network**, where residents become the first line of defense against coastal threats.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable **fast and easy reporting** of coastal threats by local users.  
- Build a **real-time dashboard** for authorities/NGOs to view threats on a map.  
- Provide **early alerts** to nearby residents when threats are verified.  
- Encourage **community participation** by gamifying contributions.

## 🧩 Key Features (MVP)
- **User App:**  
  - Login (Firebase Authentication)  
  - Submit report (photo, description, geotag)  
  - View current alerts in the region  

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  - Map of reports with status  
  - Overlay of weather & tide data  
  - Alert creation & broadcast  

- **Backend:**  
  - Firebase Firestore for storage  
  - OpenWeatherMap + WorldTides API integration  
  - Simple rules for verifying & issuing alerts  

---

## 🌍 Target Impact
- **Fisherfolk:** Safer fishing trips with tide/flood alerts.  
- **Farmers:** Protection of coastal farmland from sudden flooding.  
- **Residents:** Early evacuation during storm surges.  
- **Local authorities/NGOs:** Faster disaster response, verified by community data.  

This system strengthens **resilience** and **community ownership** of coastal safety.

## 🔧 Tech Stack (Proposed)
- **Frontend:** React / React Native (Expo)  
- **Dashboard:** React + Mapbox / Leaflet  
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions)  
- **APIs:** OpenWeatherMap (weather), WorldTides (tide levels)  

---

## 🕒 48-Hour Hackathon Plan
- **Day 1:**  
  - Setup Firebase, build report form, save reports in Firestore.  
  - Display reports on dashboard map.  

- **Day 2:**  
  - Integrate weather/tide API.  
  - Add alert creation workflow.  
  - Display alerts feed in user app.  
  - Deploy + prepare demo.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Push notifications & SMS alerts for remote villages.  
- AI-based auto-validation of images (erosion/flood detection).  
- Historical trend analysis using satellite imagery.  
- Regional language support for inclusivity.  

---

## 👥 Team Roles
- **Frontend:** Build user app for reporting & alerts.  
- **Dashboard:** Map visualization & admin workflow.  
- **Backend:** Firebase setup, API integration.  
- **Docs & Demo:** Wireframes, presentation, video demo.  

---

## 📽 Demo Flow (for judges)
1. User submits photo of flooding with GPS location.  
2. Admin dashboard shows the report + live tide/weather data.  
3. Admin verifies and issues an alert.  
4. Nearby users receive the alert in their feed.

## 🌟 Why This Project?
- **Impactful:** Saves lives and property by enabling faster response.  
- **Feasible:** Uses simple tech stack (Firebase + React + APIs).  
- **Scalable:** Start small in one village, expand to entire coastlines.  
- **Innovative:** Blends **community participation** with **scientific data**.
